# Tutorial 2 - Modeling a Robot

## Abstract

In this practical lecture you will model a simple robot in the **U**niversal **R**obot **D**escription **F**ormat (URDF). The format is described in detail at the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf).

In this tutorial you should:
- Get to know the basic syntax of URDF
- Get a feel for the workflow

At the end of the tutorial, we will see how to export a robot from Solidworks with the help of the [Solidworks2URDFExporter](http://wiki.ros.org/sw_urdf_exporter).

## Hints
- Use the URDF syntax as described in the wiki
- The given tutorial on how to model R2D2 is great for starting!

## Task

- Model a simple pendulum with a length of 1 m
- Add a mass of 1 kg at the middle of the pendulum
- Assume a simple cylinder as a collision and visual shape
