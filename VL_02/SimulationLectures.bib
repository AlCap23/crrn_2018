I and II (SSCM 14) of Solving Ordinary Differential Equations together are the standard text on numerical methods for ODEs. ...This book is well written and is together with Vol. II, the most comprehensive modern text on numerical integration methods for ODEs. It may serve a a text book for graduate courses, ...and also as a reference book for all those who have to solve ODE problems numerically." Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Physik "… This book is a valuable tool for students of mathematics and specialists concerned with numerical analysis, mathematical physics, mechanics, system engineering, and the application of computers for design and planning…" Optimization "… This book is highly recommended as a text for courses in numerical methods for ordinary differential equations and as a reference for the worker. It should be in every library, both academic and industrial." Mathematics and Computers},

	abstract = {The subject of this book is the solution of stiff differential equations and of differential-algebraic systems (differential equations with constraints). There is a chapter on one-step and extrapolation methods for stiff problems, another on multistep methods and general linear methods for stiff problems, a third on the treatment of singular perturbation problems, and a last one on differential-algebraic problems with applications to constrained mechanical systems. The beginning of each chapter is of introductory nature, followed by practical applications, the discussion of numerical results, theoretical investigations on the order and accuracy, linear and nonlinear stability, convergence and asymptotic expansions. Stiff and differential-algebraic problems arise everywhere in scientific computations (e.g. in physics, chemistry, biology, control engineering, electrical network analysis, mechanical systems). Many applications as well as computer programs are presented. Ernst Hairer and Gerhard Wanner were jointly awarded the 2003 Peter Henrici Prize at ICIAM 2003 in Sydney, Australia.},

	url = {//www.springer.com/de/book/9780387743141},
	abstract = {Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms presents the subject of computational rigid-body dynamics through the medium of spatial 6D vector notation. It explains how to model a rigid-body system and how to analyze it, and it presents the most comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms to be found in a single source. The use of spatial vector notation greatly reduces the volume of algebra which allows systems to be described using fewer equations and fewer quantities. It also allows problems to be solved in fewer steps, and solutions to be expressed more succinctly. In addition algorithms are explained simply and clearly, and are expressed in a compact form. The use of spatial vector notation facilitates the implementation of dynamics algorithms on a computer: shorter, simpler code that is easier to write, understand and debug, with no loss of efficiency. Unique features include: • A comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms • Use of spatial (6D) vectors to greatly reduce the volume of algebra, to simplify the treatment of the subject, and to simplify the computer code that implements the algorithms • Algorithms expressed both mathematically and in pseudocode for easy translation into computer programs • Source code for many algorithms available on the internet Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms is aimed at readers who already have some elementary knowledge of rigid-body dynamics, and are interested in calculating the dynamics of a rigid-body system. This book serves as an algorithms recipe book as well as a guide to the analysis and deeper understanding of rigid-body systems.},

	abstract = {This introduction to robotics offers a distinct and unified perspective of the mechanics, planning and control of robots. Ideal for self-learning, or for courses, as it assumes only freshman-level physics, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra and a little bit of computing background. Modern Robotics presents the state-of-the-art, screw-theoretic techniques capturing the most salient physical features of a robot in an intuitive geometrical way. With numerous exercises at the end of each chapter, accompanying software written to reinforce the concepts in the book and video lectures aimed at changing the classroom experience, this is the go-to textbook for learning about this fascinating subject.},
